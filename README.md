# **Introduction:**

In the manual testing project, it is difficult to have a well-defined test plan, manageable test schedule, visualization of the project using a mind map, meaningful test cases, understandable reports and hazel-free bug reports using jira. This project aims to provide all the things.

# **Test Plan:**

This test plan is a rule book for testing the project. It describes the scope and approach also. The plan identifies the risk of the product and also helps to mitigate the risk. This Test plan contains:

•	Analyse the product

•	Develop a test strategy

•	Define test objective

•	Define test criteria

•	Resource planning

•	Test environment

•	Estimation

•	Release and test deliverables

# **Test Schedule:**

This test schedule is a list of activities, tasks, or events of the test process, identifying their intended start and finish dates and/or times, and interdependencies.

# **Mindmaps:**

These mindmaps serve as a visual aid to understand the test coverage, dependencies between different features, modules and potential areas of focus during testing.

# **Test Cases:**

These test cases are designed to verify that the application is operating as expected. Each test case should include the following information:

•	Test case ID

•	Test case description

•	Expected result

•	Actual result

•	Test data

•	Reproducing steps

•	Bug Screenshots

•	Status

# **Test Report:**

In this Reports may include defect reports, test execution reports, test summary reports, and any other relevant documentation.

# **Bug Report (Excel & JIRA):**

Jira is the most effective tool for tracking & reporting bugs. In this project Jira for reporting the bug to the developer and track the bug also.
